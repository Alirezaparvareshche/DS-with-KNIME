# DS-with-KNIME
This repository is created for a "Data Science with KNIME" course.

Participatns should fork this repository and upload reqired assignment files after each session.

The Final Score for each assignment is calculated as described here: You have 100 points at first. For missing each task's main activity you lose 10 points and having minor mistakes reduces 5 points of your starting points.This will be your score as "Completeness" of assignment. After calculating the completeness of assignment, you lose 2.5% of your score for each extra commit you had (each time you amend your assignment after getting instructor's feedback so the instrucor checks your assignment again = 1 extra commit) and 0.5% for each hour you delayed doing the assignment. A "Bonus Score" will be added to your assignment score if there is something creative or interesting in your assignment (The assignment score may not exceed 100).

The Final Score will be the average of all the assignment scores.

Good luck.
